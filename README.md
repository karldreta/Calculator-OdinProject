## The Final Foundations Solution

--- Just gimme yo numbers and I'll Calc U Later.

###  [See Live Preview](https://karldreta.github.io/calculator-odinProject/)

## Here I will synthesize everything I learned from HTML,CSS and Javascript to create a calculator from scratch.


## 8 MAY 2024
-- Whoaaah, Tha was hard.

## What I learned
-- I learned to refine my conditionals (if-else statements).
-- I learned to use helper functions (Flagging isEqualsPressed(), isOperator(), etc)
-- I learned to use Methods the right way.
-- My DOM Manipulation skills were hammered.
-- Learned the benefit of writing pseudocodes (A lot of it).
-- Reading Complex Code
-- Asking Questions

-- I also learned something new -- global problem solving (I like to call it), when encountering a problem that seems unsolvable, don't try to generalize it, asking questions one after the other, just solve it globally, e.g.:

```    if(a === '' || b === '' || operator === '') {
        firstNum = '';
        lastNum = '';
        operator = '';
        result = 0
    }
```
Instead of asking what a,b, or the operator should be before you display NaN, just use "0", for everything. It may not be too practical but well, that's just me for now.

-- Most of critical thinking I had to do myself, since I was the only one who understands the context of my code, even ChatGPT is not able to help out.

## Conclusion
-- Given that this is the last foundations project, it is by far the hardest for me yet. It took me 2 weeks to finish it, but it was definitely worth it. I am ready to choose my path forward.
